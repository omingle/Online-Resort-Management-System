# WTL-Mini-Project
The project aims at implementing a Resort Management System which can be used by customers to view resorts, see facilities, check availability, reserve rooms, and also by resort owner and administrator to oversee operations of the resorts. The proposed system is meant to overcome the problems of manual or offline booking system, be it through phone calls or through third-party booking agents or platforms. Using this system, the customers can interact directly with the resort management. The system can manage and keep records of resorts, customers and customers’ previous visits online.
